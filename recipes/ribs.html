            <li>½ tbsp smoked paprika</li>
         </ul>        
        <h4>For the slaw</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>300g white cabbage, cored and thinly sliced</li>
             <li>200g carrots, coarsely grated</li>
             <li>1¼ tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
             <li>225g mayonnaise</li>
             <li>½ tsp cracked black pepper</li>
             <li>¼ tbsp granulated sugar</li>
          </ul>


        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Combine the sea salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion granules and paprika in a deep roasting tin and evenly coat the ribs. Add 230ml water and cover tightly with a double layer of foil, then cook for 3 hrs.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the BBQ sauce. Put the onion, pepper and celery in a large, deep pan with 70ml water, cover, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and cook for 30 mins. Add the garlic cloves, re-cover and cook for 30 mins more, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, allow to cool a little and blitz with a stick blender until smooth. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and 85ml water, mix  well and return to the heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring regularly so that the sugar dissolves. Continue to simmer for 1½ hrs until reduced by a quarter and thickened. Remove the lemon slices with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
            <li>Mix the slaw ingredients together in a large bowl. Cover and transfer to the fridge for 1 hr.</li>            
            <li>Heat the barbecue until the flames have died down and the coals are white and ashy, or a griddle pan until smoking. Spoon 1 tbsp of the BBQ sauce over each cooked rib. Finish the ribs on the barbecue or griddle for 15-20 mins, turning occasionally, until they are sticky and glazed. Serve with extra BBQ sauce and the slaw on the side.</li>

        </ul>
